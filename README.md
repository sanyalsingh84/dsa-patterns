# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms — Pattern‑First (JavaScript)

> A pattern‑first approach to mastering DSA using JavaScript.
> Focused on **recognition → reasoning → clean implementation**, not memorization.

---

## 📌 How This Repository Is Structured

Problems are grouped by **patterns**, not difficulty or random order.

```
01-two-pointers/
02-sliding-window/
03-hashing/
04-prefix-sum/
05-stack/
06-queue-bfs/
07-linked-list/
08-tree/
09-graph/
10-backtracking/
11-dp/
```

Each folder contains:

- Well‑commented JavaScript solutions
- Pattern explanation
- Time & space complexity

---

## 🧭 Study Philosophy

- **Pattern recognition > memorizing solutions**
- Solve fewer problems, but deeply
- Every problem answers one question:

  > _"Which pattern does this belong to?"_
